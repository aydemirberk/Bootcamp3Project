Patika &amp; Google Casual Game Development Bootcamp 3rd Week Project

I Created Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Moon using spheres.  Added materials and skybox. 

Planets revolves around itselfs and on their orbits. I have used empty game objects and planets as seperated child objects to get different rotation and movement speed. I set different speeds to all planets.!
